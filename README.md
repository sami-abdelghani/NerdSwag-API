# NerdSwag-API
This is a repository for the back-end part of my NerdSwag E-commerce shop project. I made a project to simulate an e-commerce shop themed around selling products from my favorite games and shows as if the products were real. I made this project to learn and gain more experience in fullstack web development. This repository is for the back-end portion of my project and you should check out my front-end portion of the project by going to the NerdSwag E-Commerce Shop repository.

# What I Learned
I learned how to make a REST API, a server, node modules, HTTP requests(GET,POST,PUT), create models, create schemas, create and use a MongoDB database, how to populate data, how to use JSON, how to use URL parameters, and how to use the Mongo shell.   

# Functionality
The NerdSwag-API helps add products to the MongoDB database through Postman, gets product and account data from the database and gives it to the front-end for computations, allows the user from the front-end to send and store the account data in the database when succesfully creating an account, and allows the user from the front-end to edit their balance, wishlist, and cart data for their account.
