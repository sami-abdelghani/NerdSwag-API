# NerdSwag-API
This is a repository for the back-end part of my NerdSwag E-commerce shop project. I made a project to simulate an e-commerce shop themed around selling products from my favorite games and shows as if the products were real. I made this project to learn and gain more experience in fullstack web development. This repository is for the back-end portion of my project and you should check out my front-end portion of the project by going to the NerdSwag E-Commerce Shop repository.

# What I Learned
I learned how to make a REST API, a server, node modules, HTTP requests(GET,POST,PUT), create models, create schemas, create and use a MongoDB database, how to populate data, how to use JSON, how to use URL parameters, and how to use the Mongo shell.   

# Functionality
The NerdSwag-API helps add products to the MongoDB database through Postman, gets product and account data from the database and gives it to the front-end for computations, allows the user from the front-end to send and store the account data in the database when succesfully creating an account, and allows the user from the front-end to edit their balance, wishlist, and cart data for their account.  

# Software and languages used
Javascript,
Node JS,
body-parser,
Express,
Mongoose,
MongoDB,
npm(node package manager),
nodemon,
and Postman(To add the products in the shop to the MongoDB database)

# Demo Video
This project was done and ran locally on my computer through my localhost ports, so I made a demo video quickly showing and explaining everything about this project. Please email me at sabdelghani777@gmail.com to request the demo video, since it's too big to upload on Github and Linkedin. I hope to see your email request for my NerdSwag E-commerce shop demo video.
